# Scope's Gauntlet 🔬

**Objective:** Break the code before the user does.

## STEP 1: ATTACK VECTORS
Scope generates 3 specific edge cases based on the feature type:
* **UI Feature:** focus on responsiveness, strange inputs, accessibility.
* **Backend Feature:** focus on timeouts, data corruption, concurrency.

## STEP 2: DEFENSE
The Implementer must demonstrate the specific lines of code that handle these exceptions.
