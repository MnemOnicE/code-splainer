# Agent System Team Template
Repository template for use with the asynchronous coding agent system and predefined personas

# Workflow Triggers

Use the following triggers to invoke specific agent workflows:

*   **The Standup:** General coding tasks, feature requests, or architectural decisions.
*   **The Code Court:** Automatic trigger whenever code is generated. Ensures quality and security.
*   **Scope's Gauntlet:** Before marking a feature as "Completed". Ensures robustness against edge cases.
*   **The War Room:** Critical bugs, production outages, or security exploits. Bypasses debate for immediate action.
